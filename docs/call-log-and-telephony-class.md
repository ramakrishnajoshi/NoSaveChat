In Android, CallLog.Calls.TYPE is a constant that represents the type of call in the call log. The different values indicate different call types:

- TYPE_INCOMING = 1: Represents an incoming call
- TYPE_OUTGOING = 2: Represents an outgoing call
- TYPE_MISSED = 3: Represents a missed call
- TYPE_VOICEMAIL = 4: Represents a voicemail
- TYPE_REJECTED = 5: Represents a rejected call
- TYPE_BLOCKED = 6: Represents a blocked call
- TYPE_ANSWERED_EXTERNALLY = 7: Represents a call that was answered on another device
These constants are used when querying or displaying call logs to differentiate between different types of calls.
