# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Adjust if your main branch has a different name (e.g., master)
  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events targeted at the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Adjust if your main branch has a different name

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up JDK (Android development requires Java)
      # Choose a version compatible with your project's Gradle and Android Gradle Plugin
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin' # Or 'zulu', 'adopt', etc.
          cache: 'gradle' # Cache Gradle dependencies based on lock files

      # Step 3: Grant execute permission for gradlew
      # Needed because checkout doesn't preserve execute permissions
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x gradlew

      # Step 4: Run Android Lint

      #  run: ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest

      # Step 8: Build Debug APK
      # Ensures the app actually builds
      - name: Build Debug APK
        run: ./gradlew assembleDebug
